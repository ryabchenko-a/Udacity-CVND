This repository contains projects for computer vision nanodegree by Udacity. 
The programs covers wide range of material, starting from the fundamentals (image representation, feature vectors, and convolutions) all the way to 
the more sophisticated techniques (YOLO, faster-RCNN, RNNs including LSTM and GRU, and SLAM). To learn more, click [here.](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891)

## Project 1: Facial Keypoints Detection
![Facial Keypoints Detection](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61123874/119511267-88901f00-bd72-11eb-9024-bca9a7dc28a8.png)

This project uses haar-cascades in order to find faces on the image and then uses CNN to find the keypoints on those faces.  
You can find the source code and more detailed documentation in [this folder.](https://github.com/ryabchenko-a/Udacity-CVND/tree/main/Facial%20Keypoints%20Detector)

## Project 2: Image Captioning

This project uses CNN-RNN (LSTM) model to automatically generate caption for images.

## Project 3: SLAM (Simultaneous Location and Mapping)

This project uses kalman-filter based SLAM to localize a virtual robot and create the map of surrounding landmarks.

## Extracurriculars

Besides 3 main modules, the nanodegree provides an opportunity to complement your knowledge with its 6 extracurricular courses, which include:   
1. Applications of Computer Vision and Deep Learning
2. PyTorch Course
3. Skin Cancer Detection
4. Text Sentiment Analysis
5. More Deep Learning Models (FCNs)
6. C++ Programming

Courses 4 and 6 allow to conduct another 2 projects:  
### Review Sentiment Analysis
![Text Sentiment Analysis](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61123874/119511277-8af27900-bd72-11eb-952e-6a126b795c7f.png)

This project introduces you with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and guides you through creating an NLP model which is capable of predict the sentiment 
(Positive/Negative) for a review, from scratch. Although this project is much more guided, it provides valuable intuition for approaching NLP.  
You can find the source code and more detailed documentation in [this folder.](https://github.com/ryabchenko-a/Udacity-CVND/tree/main/Extracurriculars/Text%20Sentiment%20Analysis)

### C++ Code Optimization
![C++ optimization](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61123874/119511262-87f78880-bd72-11eb-8ead-225c4f4d9504.png)

This project is more of an exercise, which aims to introduce some basic optimization techniques, such as passing by reference, 
optimizing if statements and for loops, clearing out intermediate variables, reserving storage for vectors, and using static const variables.
